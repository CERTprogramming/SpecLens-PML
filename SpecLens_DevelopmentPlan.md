SpecLens -- Project Proposal & Development Plan 1. Project Summary
SpecLens-PML aims to deliver an end-to-end MLOps system for risk
assessment of formal specifications. The project integrates data
engineering, machine learning, deployment, and operational governance.

2.  Deliverables

-   Data pipeline for PML parsing and dataset generation
-   ML kernel for training and evaluation
-   Configuration layer (config.yaml)
-   Continuous Training engine (ct_trigger.py)
-   Inference service
-   Three technical documents

3.  Milestones M1: Dataset pipeline operational M2: Baseline ML model
