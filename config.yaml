# Central configuration file for SpecLens-PML.
# This file defines model hyperparameters, operational risk thresholds
# and continuous training governance policies.

model:
  # Baseline classifier used in the training pipeline
  type: random_forest

  # Number of trees in the Random Forest ensemble
  n_estimators: 100

  # Maximum depth of each decision tree (controls complexity)
  max_depth: 5

  # Handle class imbalance by weighting minority classes more strongly
  class_weight: balanced

risk_thresholds:
  # Operational thresholds used during inference to map risk scores
  # into qualitative decision levels (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

  # Scores below this value are considered LOW risk
  low: 0.2

  # Scores between low and medium are considered MEDIUM risk
  medium: 0.6

continuous_training:
  # Minimum acceptable accuracy for the active model.
  # If performance drops below this threshold, retraining may be triggered.
  min_accuracy: 0.7

  # Safety-oriented metric: minimum recall required on the RISKY class.
  # Model promotion only occurs if this metric improves.
  min_recall_risky: 0.6

  # Enable retraining when dataset drift or degradation is detected
  retrain_on_drift: true
