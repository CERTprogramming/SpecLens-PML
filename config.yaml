# ======================================================
# SpecLens-PML Configuration
# ======================================================
#
# Central configuration file for the SpecLens-PML project.
#
# This file defines:
# - Candidate model families (baseline + challenger)
# - Operational risk thresholds for inference
# - Continuous Training governance policies
#
# The system follows a Champion/Challenger MLOps workflow:
#
#   TRAIN → Train candidates → TEST → Promote champion → UNSEEN → Feedback
#
# ======================================================


# ------------------------------------------------------
# Candidate Models (Baseline + Challenger)
# ------------------------------------------------------

models:

  # Baseline candidate: Logistic Regression
  logistic:
    enabled: true
    max_iter: 1000

  # Challenger candidate: Random Forest
  forest:
    enabled: true
    n_estimators: 200
    max_depth: 5
    random_state: 42


# ------------------------------------------------------
# Operational Risk Thresholds (Inference)
# ------------------------------------------------------

risk_thresholds:
  # Risk scores produced by the classifier are mapped into
  # qualitative operational levels.

  # Scores below this value are considered LOW risk
  low: 0.20

  # Scores between LOW and MEDIUM are considered MEDIUM risk
  medium: 0.60

  # Scores above MEDIUM are considered HIGH risk
  # (implicit: > medium)


# ------------------------------------------------------
# Continuous Training Governance (MLOps Policies)
# ------------------------------------------------------

mlops:

  # Safety-oriented promotion metric:
  # Champion is selected by maximizing Recall on the RISKY class.
  min_recall_risky: 0.60

  # Feedback-driven retraining trigger:
  # Retraining starts only if at least N unseen examples have been
  # collected into the feedback pool.
  feedback_trigger_size: 2

  # Retrain automatically if no champion model exists yet
  retrain_if_no_champion: true

  # Promotion policy:
  # A new candidate is promoted only if it improves over the current champion.
  promote_only_if_better: true

  # Reproducibility option (recommended for exams)
  deterministic_runs: false
